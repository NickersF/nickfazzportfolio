# Front End Developer Portfolio of Nicholas Fazzolari

Source code repository for front-end developer portfolio. The purpose
of the site is to give future employers and clients an overview of my
skills and projects.

This living document will contain information relevant to the project and will be
updated over time.

## Current Edition of Site

The site is currently static and all the text content is in-line aside from the contact form.
I did this for a few reasons:

1. Simplicty of the content - the content is currently informational aside from the form submission process.
2. Due to the reasoning in step one there is no reason to break the optimization of the site.
